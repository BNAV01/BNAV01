## About Me

I am a Full Stack Developer and a Civil Engineering student in Computer Science and Telecommunications from Chile. I build SaaS products and institutional platforms focused on security, traceability, and operational reliability.

Backend: Java and Spring Boot for REST APIs, Spring Security, JPA Hibernate, JWT, RBAC, audit logs, and account protection (lockout, session hardening). I work with MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and PostgreSQL, and I add Redis when caching or messaging is needed.

Frontend: Angular with TypeScript, PrimeNG, Tailwind, plus SSR for public sites where performance and SEO matter.

Mobile: Flutter apps with geolocation, notifications, and API consumption.
