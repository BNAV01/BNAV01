## About Me

I am a Full Stack Developer and a Civil Engineering student in Computer Science and Telecommunications from Chile. I build SaaS products and institutional platforms with a pragmatic focus on real time operations, security, and traceability.

On the backend, I develop REST APIs with Java and Spring Boot, using Spring Security, JPA Hibernate, and JWT. I implement role based access control, protected routes with login redirect and return, lockout after repeated failed attempts, IP and device binding for stronger sessions, and detailed audit logging for critical actions. I work with MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and PostgreSQL, and I use Redis when caching or messaging is required.

On the frontend, I build admin and client portals with Angular, TypeScript, PrimeNG, and Tailwind. I also work with SSR for public sites where performance and SEO matter. On mobile, I develop Flutter apps for patients and ambulance drivers, including geolocation, notifications, and API consumption.

## Main Project

### EMERGENCY APP (MediConnect)

A SaaS platform for emergency management and triage across multiple clinics. It centralizes patients, ambulances, and operators in real time, improving response speed, traceability, and clinic level control.

#### Who it is for
- Clinics and medical centers with internal fleets or external ambulance services
- 24 7 dispatch and monitoring operators
- Ambulance drivers
- Patients or companions who request help and track status

#### Problems it solves
- Disorganized alerts across clinics
- Slow dispatch due to lack of visibility
- Weak control over who accesses the system and from which device
- Low traceability of the emergency case, triage decisions, and route history

#### Value proposition
- Rule based triage and alerting
- Live fleet monitoring
- Multi clinic operation on a single platform
- JWT security with device and IP binding
- Full audit trail of changes and critical actions

#### System components
- Patient mobile app: request emergency and track case progress
- Driver view: receive assignments, navigate, confirm states
- Client portal: clinic operations dashboard, triage queue, transfers
- Admin portal: multi tenant management, permissions, licensing, catalogs
- Spring Boot backend: business rules, security, and tracking integrations

#### Key features
- Users, roles, and permissions management
- Protected routes with login redirect and return to the original screen
- Change logs and entity level traceability
- Emergency case lifecycle with triage and state flow
- Notifications and case status updates
- File upload and evidence viewing
- Multi tenant segmentation by clinic
- Licensing model prepared by company and clinic, including account enable block controls

#### Security
- JWT authentication
- Role based authorization
- Lockout on repeated failed attempts
- IP and device binding to reinforce sessions
- Auditing for critical actions
